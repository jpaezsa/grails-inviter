Grails Inviter Plugin
=====================

***

This is not the official repo for Grails Inviter Plugin.

Do NOT fork this repo.

The official repo is [tomaslin / grails-inviter](https://github.com/tomaslin/grails-inviter)

***

The grails inviter plugin allows you to quickly import contacts from various social networks and mail providers into your application. 

You can see it in action at http://inviter.cloudfoundry.com

It is similar in functionality to the following social sharing plugins:

* [OpenInviter](http://openinviter.com/) - PHP 
* [Plaxo Social Widget](http://www.plaxo.com/api/widget) - Web  
* [Jainrain Engage Social Sharing](http://www.janrain.com/products/engage/social-sharing) - Web 

The main difference of this plugin is that it uses Groovy / Grails and can be deeply integrated quickly and easily to any grails site.
When possible, the plugin uses each platform's authentication to comply with the policies set by each provider ( rather than scrapping address book information ). 

Under the hood, the plugin uses the excellent [Scribe oAuth library](https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java) by Pablo Fernandez.


Supported Networks
==================

The plugin currently supports the following networks

* Facebook - writes invitation on user's wall
* Google - retrieves email
* Yahoo - retrieves email
* Twitter - sends a direct message
* LinkedIn - sends a linkedIn message
* Windows Live - sends an Invitation


Warning - read me first
=======================

This plugin is considered early alpha and should not be used in production. 


Facebook
--------

Currently, Facebook APIs do not provide a mechanism for directly messaging users. As a result, this plugin implements an invitation by writing on a friend's wall ( similar to the AirBnB invite friends invitation ). 
The drawback of this approach is that if friends mark your post as Spam or hide it, your application might be flagged as spam. 

A better alternative is to use the send dialogs provided by facebook instead of this plugin. https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/send/


Windows Live
------------

This plugin uses the 4.1 version of the windows live connector as the 5.0 version does not provide a way to access emails or send invitations ( http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/messengerconnect/thread/1b325483-30f8-4390-bf76-913378fd65d7 ). 



Provided Tags
=============

The plugin includes four tags to make the process of inviting/import friends easy.


iv:invitationLink
-----------------

This tag creates a link that will point to the desired social network or email provider to initiate the invitation process.

params:

		provider - name of the provider
        pick - true/false if true the displayed form will be only to pick contacts (without sending invites).
               default: false

usage:

		<iv:invitationLink provider="facebook">
          This is a link to send invites to your facebook friends
        </iv:invitationLink>
        
		<iv:invitationLink provider="google" pick="true">
          This is a link to choose between your google contacts
        </iv:invitationLink>


iv:contacts
-----------

This tag embeds a friend selector from the list of contacts retrieved from the social network. 
Selected friends are stored in a javascript array called addresses and, if specified, in a hidden field on the same page called addresses.

params:

		contacts - list of contacts

usage:

		<iv:contacts contacts="${ contacts }"/>

The contacts tag. You must also include the inviter css, js and jquery files for this tag to work properly.

		<g:javascript library="inviter" plugin='inviter'/>
		<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href="${ resource( dir:'css', file:'inviter.css', plugin:'inviter') }" />


iv:messageForm
--------------

This tag creates a submit form to interact with the contact selector and sends a message to the invited person.

params:

		provider - name of the provider, e.g. facebook

		link - the link to embed to the invitation message

		subject - in emails, the subject of the invitation message

		message - the message to embed

		canEditMessages - if enabled, this allows the message to be sent to be customized

		redirectUrl - the Url to return the user to after invitations have been sent


        For facebook:

		description - the description of the link to be sent

		caption - the photo caption

		picture - the image to attach



usage:

		<iv:messageForm provider="${ provider }"
				link="http://inviter.cloudfoundry.com"
				subject="join grails inviter"
				description="grails inviter"
				caption="picture caption"
				picture="http://www.grails.org/static/cXmUZIAv28XIiNgkRiz4RRl21TsGZ5HoGpZw1UITNyV.png"
				redirectUrl="http://inviter.cloudfoundry.com/success"
				message="join grails inviter"
				canEditMessage="true"
		/>


iv:pickForm
--------------

This tag creates a submit form to interact with the contact selector and tell to a custom action which friends user has chosen.

In this case the real processing of the contacts, is left to the app.


params:

        controller [required] - name of the controller as in g:form tag
        
        action [required] - name of the action as in g:form tag

		provider - name of the provider, e.g. facebook

		link - the link to embed to the invitation message

		subject - in emails, the subject of the invitation message

		redirectUrl - the Url to return the user to after invitations have been sent


        For facebook:

		description - the description of the link to be sent

		caption - the photo caption

		picture - the image to attach



usage:

		<iv:messageForm controller="${ controller }" action="${ action }"
                provider="${ provider }"
				link="http://inviter.cloudfoundry.com"
				subject="join grails inviter"
				description="grails inviter"
				caption="picture caption"
				picture="http://www.grails.org/static/cXmUZIAv28XIiNgkRiz4RRl21TsGZ5HoGpZw1UITNyV.png"
				redirectUrl="http://inviter.cloudfoundry.com/success"
		/>


Testing
-------

The plugin includes a service called TestInviterService. Use:

 	<iv:invitationLink provider="test"> This is a link to test contacts </iv:invitationLink>

The test service returns a list of 20 contacts with emails.

In test/apps you can find a demo app using [Greenmail Plugin](http://grails.org/plugin/greenmail) to display mail messages not actually sent.


Modifying your views
----------------------------

For most cases, you want to create your own views.

The views you can overwrite are: 

  * inviter/contacts.gsp : the view with the 'invite friends' form
  * inviter/pickContacts.gsp : the view with the 'pick friends' form
  * inviter/sent.gsp : the view displayed after invites have been sent.


Use the example within the plugin to guide you.


Custom provider
---------------

To add a new provider, simply create a service with a name `${provider}InviterService` implemented needed methods: look at FacebookInviterService and TestInviterService for 
examples of a service using email and one using custom API.

See DemoInviterService in the test app to see an actual implementation.


Configuration
=============

The plugin requires credentials to be added to each provider used by your application.

Please read the Authentication Credentials section on how to configure each social network.

i18n
----

Plugin uses following keys:

    grails.plugin.inviter.contacts.search = Find friends :
    grails.plugin.inviter.contacts.selectAll = Select all
    grails.plugin.inviter.contacts.clearSelection = Deselect all
    grails.plugin.inviter.invitationForm.submit = Invite friends
    grails.plugin.inviter.pickForm.submit = Pick friends

To fully customize i18 for your app, overwrite the keys and declare (before the call to inviter.js - so probably before you declare `<r:require module="inviter"/>` )
a js variable `INVITER_FILTER_BLANK`.

Its value is used as placeholder in the search form.


    <script>var INVITER_FILTER_BLANK = '<g:message code="a.key.for.contacts.search.placeholder" />';</script>
